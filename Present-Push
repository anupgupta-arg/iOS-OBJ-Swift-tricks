if you are trying to present your View you can do with 2 ways

1. Method 1

      let storyBoard : UIStoryboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Settings", bundle: nil)
      let vc = storyBoard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "SettingsVCID");
      present(vc, animated: true, completion: nil)
      
      
      but Using method 1 you can't push view controller from your Presented view controller 
2. Method 2 

    let storyBoard : UIStoryboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Settings", bundle: nil)
            let vc = storyBoard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "SettingsVCID");
            let navCntr = UINavigationController.init(rootViewController: vc);
            
            let window = UIApplication.shared.keyWindow;
            window?.rootViewController?.present(navCntr, animated: true, completion: nil);

this is good way now you can do push view controller from your Presented view controller
